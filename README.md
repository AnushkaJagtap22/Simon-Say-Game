# Simon-Say-Game
Simon Says is a memory-based game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Players follow and repeat a growing sequence of flashing colored buttons. Each correct input increases the level. A wrong click ends the game and shows the final score. Responsive, interactive, and perfect for practicing DOM and event handling.
